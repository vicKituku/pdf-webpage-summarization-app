       "'Internet connectivity in several African countries was interrupted Thursday after major undersea cables experienced temporary faults, network providers have reported.\\xa0Netblocks, an internet monitoring company, revealed that Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin experienced severe outages lasting up to 12 hours.The Gambia and Guinea had less severe disruptions as the internet was restored after half an hour.The West African Cable System (WACS) and SAT-3 cables off the Abidjan coast faced a downtime.\\xa0African Telecommunications giant, MTN Group, has reported internet outages in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, promising to solve the issue within the shortest time possible.\\xa0ADVERTISEMENT“Recognising the critical importance of consistent internet and communication services, we are fully committed to swiftly addressing these disruptions,” said MTN in a statement.\\xa0According to My Broadband, South African internet users had difficulties logging into Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, LinkedIn, Xbox, X(formerly Twitter), and even Whatsapp. Other Telcos like Vodacom acknowledged that slow internet connection hit areas like Gauteng and Western Cape hardest.Some internet providers reliant on the damaged cables were forced to seek alternatives, but cable cuts in the Red Sea and the East African coast affected key lines such as Seacom, TGN, and the EIG.\\xa0Submarine cables account for 90% of the continent’s internet needs. There are more than 500 active undersea cables around the world. Minor damages have slowed internet connectivity but it is still unclear whether sabotage plays a part in these events.Likely ReasonsAlthough it is still unclear what caused the cable cuts, the likeliest reason is seismic activity off the coast of Ivory Coast, which worsened the situation caused by ongoing attacks on maritime traffic off the coast of Yemen on the other side of the continent.In mid February, escalating Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea included missile attacks on a bulk carrier named the Rubymar. The ship’s hull was damaged on February 18th, forcing the crew to abandon it. It eventually sunk on 3rd March, and analysts believe that it may have been dragging its anchor on the sea floor, damaging the undersea cables. The sinking also poses environmental risks, as the ship was hauling 21, 000 metric tons of fertiliser, and the damage caused extensive oil spills.The spilling over of the Israel-Palestine conflict into the Red Sea has posed great risks to maritime traffic using the crucial route. It has forced insurance companies to hike premiums, and shipping companies to use the longer route to the south of the African continent.The internet disruptions now present a new element in the conflict, as repairs in the Red Sea have been complicated by the fact that the cuts are on Yemeni territorial waters. According to Seacom and other cable operators, repairs will take up to eight weeks, and undersea cable operators have been forced to rely on redundancies and reroute internet traffic to other cables.The disruptions have also stimulated discussion on the transition to Satellite internet, which is still costly and unpopular in the continent.\\xa0They also raise critical questions on the safety of the continent’s digital infrastructure at a time when African countries are moving towards a digital future.Telkom Lands New 6th Subsea Cable in Kenya '"

      "Undersea Cable Cuts Disrupt Internet in Several African Countries Internet connectivity in several African countries was interrupted Thursday after major undersea cables experienced temporary faults, network providers have reported. Netblocks, an internet monitoring company, revealed that Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin experienced severe outages lasting up to 12 hours.The Gambia and Guinea had less severe disruptions as the internet was restored after half an hour.The West African Cable System (WACS) and SAT-3 cables off the Abidjan coast faced a downtime. African Telecommunications giant, MTN Group, has reported internet outages in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, promising to solve the issue within the shortest time possible. ADVERTISEMENT“Recognising the critical importance of consistent internet and communication services, we are fully committed to swiftly addressing these disruptions,” said MTN in a statement. According to My Broadband, South African internet users had difficulties logging into Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, LinkedIn, Xbox, X(formerly Twitter), and even Whatsapp. Other Telcos like Vodacom acknowledged that slow internet connection hit areas like Gauteng and Western Cape hardest.Some internet providers reliant on the damaged cables were forced to seek alternatives, but cable cuts in the Red Sea and the East African coast affected key lines such as Seacom, TGN, and the EIG. Submarine cables account for 90% of the continent’s internet needs. There are more than 500 active undersea cables around the world. Minor damages have slowed internet connectivity but it is still unclear whether sabotage plays a part in these events.Likely ReasonsAlthough it is still unclear what caused the cable cuts, the likeliest reason is seismic activity off the coast of Ivory Coast, which worsened the situation caused by ongoing attacks on maritime traffic off the coast of Yemen on the other side of the continent.In mid February, escalating Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea included missile attacks on a bulk carrier named the Rubymar. The ship’s hull was damaged on February 18th, forcing the crew to abandon it. It eventually sunk on 3rd March, and analysts believe that it may have been dragging its anchor on the sea floor, damaging the undersea cables. The sinking also poses environmental risks, as the ship was hauling 21, 000 metric tons of fertiliser, and the damage caused extensive oil spills.The spilling over of the Israel-Palestine conflict into the Red Sea has posed great risks to maritime traffic using the crucial route. It has forced insurance companies to hike premiums, and shipping companies to use the longer route to the south of the African continent.The internet disruptions now present a new element in the conflict, as repairs in the Red Sea have been complicated by the fact that the cuts are on Yemeni territorial waters. According to Seacom and other cable operators, repairs will take up to eight weeks, and undersea cable operators have been forced to rely on redundancies and reroute internet traffic to other cables.The disruptions have also stimulated discussion on the transition to Satellite internet, which is still costly and unpopular in the continent. They also raise critical questions on the safety of the continent’s digital infrastructure at a time when African countries are moving towards a digital future.Telkom Lands New 6th Subsea Cable in Kenya \n",
      "Kigali Gears Up for Africa CEO Forum 2024 The 2024 Africa CEO Forum, scheduled for May 16th and 17th in Kigali, Rwanda, will gather over 2,000 CEOs, investors, and public sector leaders from across Africa and beyond.The 2024 theme; “At the Table or On the Menu? A Critical Moment to Shape a New Future for Africa,” reflects the urgency for the continent to assert itself on the global stage and actively contribute to discussions shaping its future.Now in its 11th edition, this year’s Africa CEO Forum the Africa CEO Forum will focus on four transformative agendas: leadership, digital transformation, continental integration, and financing.Through panel discussions, workshops, and roundtables, participants will explore strategies to set high public policy standards conducive to growth, position African businesses at the forefront of disruptive innovation, leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and overcome financing obstacles to support Africa’s ambitions.Additionally, the forum will address obstacles to financing Africa’s ambitions and foster creative solutions in this regard.“We call on our community of leaders shaping the future of Africa to recognise the structural and enduring consequences of the actions they take at this critical time. The forum will be a crucible for innovative strategies and partnerships, propelling the continent into the opportunities of tomorrow.” says Amir Ben Yahmed, President of the Africa CEO Forum.ADVERTISEMENTSérgio Pimenta, IFC’s Vice President for Africa, said, “Turning Africa’s $3 trillion GDP into $30 trillion by 2050 will require an unbridled African private sector, enabled by the continent’s policymakers to forge partnerships that create markets, increase intra-African trade and advance investment on the continent.”ALSO READ; Africa Fintech Summit Announces First Roadshow Ahead of AFTSNairobi in September \n",
      "US Sanctions Crown Bus, 15 Others, for Terror Financing The United States has sanctioned Kenyan-based transport company Crown Bus and 15 other companies and individuals for facilitating Al-Shabaab’s $100million annual income flows.The sanctioned companies include Haleel Commodities Ltd, which is based in Dubai and has subsidiaries in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, and Cyprus. The designation also includes Mohammed Jumale Ali Awale and Faysal Yusuf Dini, both based in Kenya, and at least one other Kenyan national.In addition to being part of al-Shabaab’s financial network, the US says that Crown Bus has also “supported al-Shabaab’s logistical operations.”“Today’s action is part of a multifaceted effort by Treasury to support the Somali government’s economic offensive against al-Shabaab—one of three pillars in their campaign to degrade this deadly terrorist group,” Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said in a statement.ADVERTISEMENTThe US’ Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said that Awale and Dini’s designations are linked to each other, and to Haleel Group and Crown Bus Services. The list also includes at least three other individuals linked to Haleel’s operations in Kenya, Uganda, Cyprus and the UAE.One of them, Farhan Hussein Hayder, who the US says “directs and manages Haleel Group’s branches in Kenya, Uganda, Cyprus, and the UAE, and supports al-Shabaab by generating funds”, has previously been investigated by anti-terror police in Kenya, according to a Ugandan court document.Haleel Commodities, also known as Haleel Group, is a multinational operation whose subsidiaries include a fintech unit in Cyprus and an electronics company in Somalia.Crown Bus Service was founded in 2004 and launched full operations on the Nairobi-Mombasa route in August 2006, according to the company’s profile on LinkedIn.It now covers a wide network connecting Mombasa, Nairobi, Western Kenya and destinations in Uganda.In May 2018, Uganda’s Financial Intelligence Authority froze the accounts of Haleel Group’s subsidiary and those of five other companies on suspicion that they were part of a terror financing network. The companies sued the authority and the freeze orders were lifted in September 2019.Why it MattersThe designation against companies and individuals for financing terror mainly includes sanctions against doing business in the United States or with American companies. But its true power works similar to a global blacklist since “engaging in certain transactions with the individuals designated today entails risk of secondary sanctions.”It is likely that the designation will bring renewed interest in the Kenya and Uganda based companies from local anti-terror and anti-money laundering authorities, and complicate their relationships with lenders and financial institutions. \n",
      "Kenya Woos Egyptian Investors with EU, US Trade Deals Kenya is banking on its trade deal with the European Union and its central location in East Africa to woo Egyptian investors to the country, government officials said during the Kenya-Egypt Summit in Nairobi.The Ministry of Investment, Trade & Industry is targeting the North African Country’s investors to set-up manufacturing plants that would enable finished products easily access European markets, the strategy will in turn create income and employment.ADVERTISEMENT“Kenya is a gateway to East Africa, if you manufacture here, you will be able to sell your products in eight East African Member States,” said Juma Mukhwana, Principal Secretary, State Department for Industry, Ministry of Trade and Industry said during the summit.Early this month, Kenya inched closer to concluding a trade deal with the European Union following an endorsement of economic partnership agreement by the EU Parliament. The deal, which is awaiting final approval from EU heads of state and government, offers Kenya tax-free access of exports to 27 countries in the EU bloc.“A similar deal with the United States is nearing conclusion, we encourage Egyptian companies to establish manufacturing plants in Kenya in order for the finished products to enjoy special treatment in the markets we are targeting with these trade agreements,” he said.Trade NetworksThe summit was organised by Commercial International Bank (CIB), which is keen on fostering trade between Kenya and Egypt due to its presence in the two countries. CIB, which entered into the Kenyan market four years ago, via acquisition of Mayfair Bank, is Egypt’s largest private sector lender by assets in excess of $24 billion and is listed on both the Egyptian and London stock exchanges.  The bank’s niche lies in facilitating exports and it is working to grow business links between the two countries such as with tea, where Egypt is the second-largest market for Kenyan tea exports.Kenya exports tea, coffee, nuts, meat, wheat and flowers, skin and hides as well as live animals to Egypt. On its part, Egyptian businesses export fertilizer, textiles, building materials, medicines, vehicles, electronic appliances, electricity accessories and sports equipment among others.“Since we now have a solid footprint in Kenya, we have provided a seamless platform for the businesses to unlock growth opportunities and we see that we can play an integral role in doing the same for Kenyan companies doing business with Egypt ,’’noted Ms. Daphne Maina, the Ag. CEO of CIB Kenya during the event.Egypt is shifting its economic strategy by enhancing collaboration with sub–Saharan Africa through public-private partnerships like the Kenya-Egypt forum that attracted 40 Egyptian companies among them construction, transport, water, tourism, manufacturing and healthcare. The high-level Egyptian government delegation at the forum was led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Electricity & Renewable Energy, and the Minister of Trade & Industry.CIB makes 29.7 m Egyptian Pounds in net profit in 2023 (kenyanwallstreet.com) \n",

      "Bamburi Cement Exits Ugandan Subsidiary after Selling 70% Stake Bamburi Cement PLC has sold 1.3 million ordinary shares of its Ugandan unit to Sarrai Group Limited and Rwimi Holdings amidst shrinking demand in the cement market. The cement company revealed plans to relieve its indirect ownership of Hima Cement Limited last year in November, stating that it wished to focus on its Kenyan market. The transaction valued at $120 million was approved by shareholders after a virtual general meeting held last year in December. Swiss company Cementia Holdings AG has also sold the remaining 30% stake, representing more than 500,000 shares to the two buyers completing the transaction of ownership.“The board of Bamburi takes this opportunity to extend its gratitude to all of Bamburi’s shareholders as well as the regulators, including the Capital Markets Authority, for their support to bring the transaction to completion,” said the listed company. ADVERTISEMENTSarrai Group Limited, which owns the Rai Cement factory in Kenya, intends to exercise dominance in the cement market by acquiring troubled manufacturers in Uganda and Rwanda. Bamburi’s parent firm Holcim has also sold 65% of its shares in Mbeya Cement Limited, divesting its interest to profitable markets. Bamburi’s cement production volume decreased significantly after the company announced that it would halt the manufacture of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) from Jan 1 2024. This decision was made in response to the hiked levies on clinker as per the Finance Act 2023. The company also intends to decarbonize its operations which means that key ingredients in cement manufacture will be phased out as alternatives are presented. See Also:Bamburi Cement Refutes Claim of Closure over Environment Concerns \n",
      "East African Cables Sells Majority Stake in Tanzanian Unit East African Cables PLC has sold a 51% stake in its Tanzanian subsidiary to Msufini (T) Limited as it embarks on a turnaround strategy.Msufini, a Tanzanian chemicals manufacturer, purchased 16.2 million shares from the the regional cable firm at a par value TZS 10.The Tanzanian unit has faced capital constraints, adding on to its parent company’s capital constraints.Msufini Tanzania Limited was set up in 2021 as a joint venture between a Tanzanian company called Junaco and a Malaysian company called Serba.In mid-2023, EA Cables obtained a court injunction to stop the firm’s administration by Equity Bank to auction assets worth Ksh. 3 billion to recover outstanding loans.

      "Egypt Devalues Currency, Hikes Interest Rates The Egyptian Pound lost more than 50% of its exchange rate value against the dollar after the country’s central bank adopted a flexible exchange rate, hiked interest ratesAfter an impromptu monetary policy meeting on Wednesday, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) raised interest rates by 600 base points, the second increase in a year.The interest rate hike, and allowing a flexible exchange rate, are two preconditions to Cairo obtaining more assistance from the International Monetary Fund.The move follows a $35bn deal with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) which analysts have suggested provides a buffer for tougher fiscal decisions.The country secured $8bn, and $1.2bn for sustainability, from the IMF on Wednesday, just hours after the policy changes. Exchange rate flexibility was a major precondition for more IMF assistance, but Cairo had promised to do so before, before turning around and propping the pound.ADVERTISEMENTFrom a relatively stable rate of 31 pounds to the dollar for the most of the last year, the Egyptian Pound quickly lost value in trading on Wednesday, dropping to 50 pounds to the dollar by lunch time.Egypt is facing multiple internal crises, but its recent decisions might be driven more by external ones which include the Israel-Palestine conflict, shipping attacks in the Red Sea, and other geopolitical concerns. \n",

      "Undersea Cable Cuts Disrupt Internet in Several African Countries Internet connectivity in several African countries was interrupted Thursday after major undersea cables experienced temporary faults, network providers have reported. Netblocks, an internet monitoring company, revealed that Ivory Coast, Liberia, and Benin experienced severe outages lasting up to 12 hours.The Gambia and Guinea had less severe disruptions as the internet was restored after half an hour.The West African Cable System (WACS) and SAT-3 cables off the Abidjan coast faced a downtime. African Telecommunications giant, MTN Group, has reported internet outages in Nigeria, Ghana, and South Africa, promising to solve the issue within the shortest time possible. ADVERTISEMENT“Recognising the critical importance of consistent internet and communication services, we are fully committed to swiftly addressing these disruptions,” said MTN in a statement. According to My Broadband, South African internet users had difficulties logging into Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, LinkedIn, Xbox, X(formerly Twitter), and even Whatsapp. Other Telcos like Vodacom acknowledged that slow internet connection hit areas like Gauteng and Western Cape hardest.Some internet providers reliant on the damaged cables were forced to seek alternatives, but cable cuts in the Red Sea and the East African coast affected key lines such as Seacom, TGN, and the EIG. Submarine cables account for 90% of the continent’s internet needs. There are more than 500 active undersea cables around the world. Minor damages have slowed internet connectivity but it is still unclear whether sabotage plays a part in these events.Likely ReasonsAlthough it is still unclear what caused the cable cuts, the likeliest reason is seismic activity off the coast of Ivory Coast, which worsened the situation caused by ongoing attacks on maritime traffic off the coast of Yemen on the other side of the continent.In mid February, escalating Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea included missile attacks on a bulk carrier named the Rubymar. The ship’s hull was damaged on February 18th, forcing the crew to abandon it. It eventually sunk on 3rd March, and analysts believe that it may have been dragging its anchor on the sea floor, damaging the undersea cables. The sinking also poses environmental risks, as the ship was hauling 21, 000 metric tons of fertiliser, and the damage caused extensive oil spills.The spilling over of the Israel-Palestine conflict into the Red Sea has posed great risks to maritime traffic using the crucial route. It has forced insurance companies to hike premiums, and shipping companies to use the longer route to the south of the African continent.The internet disruptions now present a new element in the conflict, as repairs in the Red Sea have been complicated by the fact that the cuts are on Yemeni territorial waters. According to Seacom and other cable operators, repairs will take up to eight weeks, and undersea cable operators have been forced to rely on redundancies and reroute internet traffic to other cables.The disruptions have also stimulated discussion on the transition to Satellite internet, which is still costly and unpopular in the continent. They also raise critical questions on the safety of the continent’s digital infrastructure at a time when African countries are moving towards a digital future.Telkom Lands New 6th Subsea Cable in Kenya \n",
      "Kigali Gears Up for Africa CEO Forum 2024 The 2024 Africa CEO Forum, scheduled for May 16th and 17th in Kigali, Rwanda, will gather over 2,000 CEOs, investors, and public sector leaders from across Africa and beyond.The 2024 theme; “At the Table or On the Menu? A Critical Moment to Shape a New Future for Africa,” reflects the urgency for the continent to assert itself on the global stage and actively contribute to discussions shaping its future.Now in its 11th edition, this year’s Africa CEO Forum the Africa CEO Forum will focus on four transformative agendas: leadership, digital transformation, continental integration, and financing.Through panel discussions, workshops, and roundtables, participants will explore strategies to set high public policy standards conducive to growth, position African businesses at the forefront of disruptive innovation, leverage the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), and overcome financing obstacles to support Africa’s ambitions.Additionally, the forum will address obstacles to financing Africa’s ambitions and foster creative solutions in this regard.“We call on our community of leaders shaping the future of Africa to recognise the structural and enduring consequences of the actions they take at this critical time. The forum will be a crucible for innovative strategies and partnerships, propelling the continent into the opportunities of tomorrow.” says Amir Ben Yahmed, President of the Africa CEO Forum.ADVERTISEMENTSérgio Pimenta, IFC’s Vice President for Africa, said, “Turning Africa’s $3 trillion GDP into $30 trillion by 2050 will require an unbridled African private sector, enabled by the continent’s policymakers to forge partnerships that create markets, increase intra-African trade and advance investment on the continent.”ALSO READ; Africa Fintech Summit Announces First Roadshow Ahead of AFTSNairobi in September \n",
      "US Sanctions Crown Bus, 15 Others, for Terror Financing The United States has sanctioned Kenyan-based transport company Crown Bus and 15 other companies and individuals for facilitating Al-Shabaab’s $100million annual income flows.The sanctioned companies include Haleel Commodities Ltd, which is based in Dubai and has subsidiaries in Kenya, Uganda, Somalia, and Cyprus. The designation also includes Mohammed Jumale Ali Awale and Faysal Yusuf Dini, both based in Kenya, and at least one other Kenyan national.In addition to being part of al-Shabaab’s financial network, the US says that Crown Bus has also “supported al-Shabaab’s logistical operations.”“Today’s action is part of a multifaceted effort by Treasury to support the Somali government’s economic offensive against al-Shabaab—one of three pillars in their campaign to degrade this deadly terrorist group,” Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, said in a statement.ADVERTISEMENTThe US’ Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said that Awale and Dini’s designations are linked to each other, and to Haleel Group and Crown Bus Services. The list also includes at least three other individuals linked to Haleel’s operations in Kenya, Uganda, Cyprus and the UAE.One of them, Farhan Hussein Hayder, who the US says “directs and manages Haleel Group’s branches in Kenya, Uganda, Cyprus, and the UAE, and supports al-Shabaab by generating funds”, has previously been investigated by anti-terror police in Kenya, according to a Ugandan court document.Haleel Commodities, also known as Haleel Group, is a multinational operation whose subsidiaries include a fintech unit in Cyprus and an electronics company in Somalia.Crown Bus Service was founded in 2004 and launched full operations on the Nairobi-Mombasa route in August 2006, according to the company’s profile on LinkedIn.It now covers a wide network connecting Mombasa, Nairobi, Western Kenya and destinations in Uganda.In May 2018, Uganda’s Financial Intelligence Authority froze the accounts of Haleel Group’s subsidiary and those of five other companies on suspicion that they were part of a terror financing network. The companies sued the authority and the freeze orders were lifted in September 2019.Why it MattersThe designation against companies and individuals for financing terror mainly includes sanctions against doing business in the United States or with American companies. But its true power works similar to a global blacklist since “engaging in certain transactions with the individuals designated today entails risk of secondary sanctions.”It is likely that the designation will bring renewed interest in the Kenya and Uganda based companies from local anti-terror and anti-money laundering authorities, and complicate their relationships with lenders and financial institutions. \n",
      "Kenya Woos Egyptian Investors with EU, US Trade Deals Kenya is banking on its trade deal with the European Union and its central location in East Africa to woo Egyptian investors to the country, government officials said during the Kenya-Egypt Summit in Nairobi.The Ministry of Investment, Trade & Industry is targeting the North African Country’s investors to set-up manufacturing plants that would enable finished products easily access European markets, the strategy will in turn create income and employment.ADVERTISEMENT“Kenya is a gateway to East Africa, if you manufacture here, you will be able to sell your products in eight East African Member States,” said Juma Mukhwana, Principal Secretary, State Department for Industry, Ministry of Trade and Industry said during the summit.Early this month, Kenya inched closer to concluding a trade deal with the European Union following an endorsement of economic partnership agreement by the EU Parliament. The deal, which is awaiting final approval from EU heads of state and government, offers Kenya tax-free access of exports to 27 countries in the EU bloc.“A similar deal with the United States is nearing conclusion, we encourage Egyptian companies to establish manufacturing plants in Kenya in order for the finished products to enjoy special treatment in the markets we are targeting with these trade agreements,” he said.Trade NetworksThe summit was organised by Commercial International Bank (CIB), which is keen on fostering trade between Kenya and Egypt due to its presence in the two countries. CIB, which entered into the Kenyan market four years ago, via acquisition of Mayfair Bank, is Egypt’s largest private sector lender by assets in excess of $24 billion and is listed on both the Egyptian and London stock exchanges.  The bank’s niche lies in facilitating exports and it is working to grow business links between the two countries such as with tea, where Egypt is the second-largest market for Kenyan tea exports.Kenya exports tea, coffee, nuts, meat, wheat and flowers, skin and hides as well as live animals to Egypt. On its part, Egyptian businesses export fertilizer, textiles, building materials, medicines, vehicles, electronic appliances, electricity accessories and sports equipment among others.“Since we now have a solid footprint in Kenya, we have provided a seamless platform for the businesses to unlock growth opportunities and we see that we can play an integral role in doing the same for Kenyan companies doing business with Egypt ,’’noted Ms. Daphne Maina, the Ag. CEO of CIB Kenya during the event.Egypt is shifting its economic strategy by enhancing collaboration with sub–Saharan Africa through public-private partnerships like the Kenya-Egypt forum that attracted 40 Egyptian companies among them construction, transport, water, tourism, manufacturing and healthcare. The high-level Egyptian government delegation at the forum was led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Electricity & Renewable Energy, and the Minister of Trade & Industry.CIB makes 29.7 m Egyptian Pounds in net profit in 2023 (kenyanwallstreet.com) \n",
